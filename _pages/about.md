I'm a PhD student at [Osaka Metropolitan University](https://www.omu.ac.jp/), exploring social and political psychology under the guidance of [Dr. Yuta Kawamura](https://ytkm2.github.io/MyWebsite/english.html), whose work bridges evolutionary psychology and cognitive science, focusing on altruism and reputation to understand the underlying mechanisms of social norms and their effects on behaviour.

Through various cities and sectors - London, Siena, Berlin, Auckland, Toronto, and Tokyo â€” across TV broadcasting, IT, recruitment, and now academia, my career has been nothing but squiggly lines. I hope this background informs my research, which explores the interplay between morality and politics, aiming to understand how our moral compass guides behaviour and societal interactions.

My research aims to offer insights that connect individual behaviour with larger societal trends. I am particularly interested in the psychological aspects of political ideologies, moral decision-making, and expressions.

I value collaboration and am keen to engage with peers who are passionate about exploring the psychological foundations of how we think and act within our societies.
