I'm a PhD student at [Osaka Metropolitan University](https://www.omu.ac.jp/), exploring social and political psychology under the guidance of [Dr. Yuta Kawamura](https://ytkm2.github.io/MyWebsite/english.html).

My career has unfolded more like a patchwork quilt than a straight line. I started chatting on TV in **Toronto**, moved on to fixing tech glitches in **London**, then placed people in firms in **Tokyo**. Along the way, I picked up part-time gigs in **Auckland** and **Munich**, while my education took me from **Toronto** to **Berlin**, **Siena**, and now **Osaka**, each step has peppered my research with some real-world seasoning.

Currently, I am on a quest to connect the dots between individual political dialogues and broader societal patterns. My research hopes to **leverage AI** to predict behaviours and explore **how social media shapes public opinion**. I am particularly interested in **the psychological cogs turning behind political beliefs and moral choices**, and how these factors influence conversations across different societies.

If you are drawn to the interplay of psychology and politics, and fancy a collaboration or chat, please feel free to reach out.

I have taken the scenic route back to academia, so my publication list is still in the making. Your patience and interest are greatly appreciated as I lay the first stones. Stay tuned for updates!

When I am not tangled in research, you will find me on the badminton court with the [Kumatori Badminton](https://instagram.com/kumatori.ladies) under the [Osaka Ladies Badminton Federation](https://www.jlbad.gr.jp/index.php/), where my enthusiasm outmatches my skill. At home, I switch gears to playing music, painting, and being indefinitely outpaced by my two sons.
