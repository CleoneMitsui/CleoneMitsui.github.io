I'm a PhD student at [Osaka Metropolitan University](https://www.omu.ac.jp/), exploring social and political psychology under the guidance of [Dr. Yuta Kawamura](https://ytkm2.github.io/MyWebsite/english.html).

My career has unfolded more like a patchwork quilt than a straight line. From early days as a TV presenter in Toronto to roles in computer technician in London and recruitment consulting in Tokyo. With part-time gigs in Auckland and Munich, and education spanning from Toronto to Berlin, Siena, and now Osaka, each step has peppered my research with some real-world seasoning.

Currently, I am on a quest to connect the dots between the individual actions and the broader societal patterns under the realms of politics. The psychological cogs turning behind political beliefs and moral choices are of keen interest to me. My research aims to uncover how these factors shape our conversations and actions across different societies.

If you are drawn to the interplay of psychology and politics, and fancy a collaboration or chat, please feel free to reach out.

**Publications**

I have taken the scenic route back to academia, so my publication list is still in the making. Manuscripts are now making their rounds in the rigorous world of peer review. Your patience and interest are greatly appreciated as I lay the first stones. Stay tuned for updates!  

**Off the Clock**  

When I am not tangled in research, you will find me on the badminton court with the [Kumatori Badminton](https://instagram.com/kumatori.ladies) under the [Osaka Ladies Badminton Federation](https://www.jlbad.gr.jp/index.php/), where my enthusiasm outmatches my skill. At home, I switch gears to play piano tunes and as for parenting my two young sons? I am consistently outpaced, outnumbered, and thoroughly entertained by their boundless energy.
