I'm Cleone (pronounced /klee-OH-nee/), a PhD student at [Osaka Metropolitan University](https://www.omu.ac.jp/), exploring political psychology under the guidance of [Dr. Yuta Kawamura](https://ytkm2.github.io/MyWebsite/english.html).

<span style="color: #1e4f66;">**Career Background**</span>  
For quite a while, my career's GPS had been stuck on "recalculating." I started chatting on TV in Toronto, moved on to fixing tech glitches in London, then placed people in firms in Tokyo. Along the way, I picked up part-time gigs in Auckland and Munich, while my education took me from Toronto to Berlin, Siena, and now Osaka. Each step has peppered my research with some real-world seasoning.

<span style="color: #1e4f66;">**Research**</span>  
Currently, I am on a quest to connect the dots between individual political dialogues and broader attitude patterns. My research hopes to **leverage AI** to predict behaviours and explore **how social media shapes public opinion**. I am particularly interested in **the psychological cogs turning behind political beliefs and moral choices**, and how these factors influence conversations across different societies.

If you fancy a collaboration or chat, please feel free to reach out.

<span style="color: #1e4f66;">**Publications**</span>  
I have taken the scenic route back to academia, so my publication list is still in the making. Your interest is greatly appreciated as I lay the first stones. Stay tuned for updates!

<span style="color: #1e4f66;">**Off the Clock**</span>  
When I am not tangled in research, you will find me on the badminton court as a member of the [Osaka Ladies Badminton Federation](https://www.jlbad.gr.jp/index.php/), where I compete in their league and international tournaments, with enthusiasm that outmatches my skill. At home, I switch gears to playing music, painting, and being indefinitely outpaced by my two sons.
